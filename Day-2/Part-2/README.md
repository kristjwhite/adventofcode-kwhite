# --- Part Two ---
While it appears you validated the passwords correctly, they don't seem to be what the Official Toboggan Corporate Authentication System is expecting.

The shopkeeper suddenly realizes that he just accidentally explained the password policy rules from his old job at the sled rental place down the street! The Official Toboggan Corporate Policy actually works a little differently.

Each policy actually describes two positions in the password, where 1 means the first character, 2 means the second character, and so on. (Be careful; Toboggan Corporate Policies have no concept of "index zero"!) Exactly one of these positions must contain the given letter. Other occurrences of the letter are irrelevant for the purposes of policy enforcement.

Given the same example list from above:

1-3 a: abcde is valid: position 1 contains a and position 3 does not.
1-3 b: cdefg is invalid: neither position 1 nor position 3 contains b.
2-9 c: ccccccccc is invalid: both position 2 and position 9 contain c.
How many passwords are valid according to the new interpretation of the policies?

## Approach
Turn the file into an array of data comprising of `[ "range letter password"]` then iterate through these individually

For each iteration, use a split to determine the first value to check and second value to check, minus one as position isn't 0 indexed

Use IsChar to check each letter in the position of the password and set a flag if it matches or not

Use an XOR logic check to make check if there is only 1 instance of the letter in the positions
